## PyCraftLogs

Basic script for working with warcraftlogs.com API. The current API is simple, but in theory will allow any valid request to the api to return the given JSON data.

## Settings
All test data is hard coded into the script currently.

API Key - you will need to insert your own WCL API key into the script.
key = "123456"
*This can be found in your account settings on warcraftlogs.com

## Future Plans
As the API is updated, I will continue to do tests against it. Eventually I plan to build this out into either a webapp or GUI based tool.
